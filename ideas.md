    <span class="badge">Hackathon</span>
    <h3>Agentic AI for Fintech: From Vision to Working Demo</h3>
    <p>Participated in an Agentic AI hackathon with a focus on real fintech challenges, co‑building a seamless, gamified flow for Pine Labs payment gateway integration.</p>
    <p>Started on a modest laptop with no local IDEs, led with product vision, then jumped into coding as ideas crystallized—prototyped with Lovable, switched to in‑browser development with GitHub Codespaces and Copilot to keep velocity high.</p>
    <p><em>Takeaway:</em> With browser‑based tooling and agent assistance, idea‑to‑demo can happen in hours—even on constrained hardware.</p>

  <!-- 2) Pega Agents via APIs (Guardrails + DX) -->
  <div class="card">
    <span class="badge">Pega + Agents</span>
    <h3>Guardrailed Agentic DX using Pega APIs</h3>
    <p>Built a conversational developer experience powered by Pega agents over APIs, with strong guardrails for predictable, controlled behavior and smooth handoffs.</p>
    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Earned runner‑up recognition; validated that Codespaces, Copilot, and especially Pega’s platform can compress build time without sacrificing reliability.</p>
    <p><em>Why it matters:</em> Pega makes creation‑to‑integration of agentic capabilities straightforward, reducing the friction teams face when starting from scratch.</p>

    <span class="badge">Conference</span>
    <h3>From Idea to Production with Pega + GenAI</h3>
    <p>Represented Enterprise App Development at Pega Innovate—highlighting predictable, transparent AI and how organizations can move from idea to production faster with the latest platform innovations.</p>
    <p>Showcased how Generative AI elevates delivery speed and quality; attendees reacted strongly to the feature set and the momentum toward the next Pega Infinity release.</p>
    <p><em>What’s next:</em> Continue pushing practical GenAI patterns into real workflows and share results publicly for community learning.</p>
