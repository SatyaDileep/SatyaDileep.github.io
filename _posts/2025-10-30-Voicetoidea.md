### The problem
Great ideas arrive away from keyboards, and unstructured notes are hard to convert into shareable product artifacts.  

### The workflow
1. Capture: record a quick voice note on phone whenever a theme or feature idea strikes.  
2. Transcribe: use auto‑transcription to get clean text to iterate on within minutes.  
3. Structure: run the text through Copilot/Gemini/Perplexity prompts to extract problem, audience, outcomes, risks, and metrics.  
4. Shape: convert the result into a PM Canvas and a simple HTML mock that can be reviewed by stakeholders.  
5. Publish: post a short card to social or share a micro‑app link for feedback.  

### Why it works
- Keeps ownership of ideas while using AI to accelerate clarity and speed.  
- Produces artifacts that are easy to circulate: a canvas, a mock, and a post‑ready card.  
- Favors browser‑first tooling so sharing is a link, not a setup.  

### Tips
- Keep a “seed prompts” note for common transformations: canvas, assumptions, risks, and success metrics.  
- End each session by capturing a 3‑bullet “decision + next step” summary to maintain momentum.  
- If a concept gets traction, graduate it into a micro‑app and measure real usage before investing more.
