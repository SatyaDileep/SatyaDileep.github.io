    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I’m an AI Product Manager working as Senior Product Manager at Pegasystems. I turn fuzzy ideas into working software—fast—using agentic patterns, small web apps, and tight feedback loops.</p>
    <p>With 13 years in industry and 2 years in product management, my focus is GenAI and agentic workflows that automate real work, not just demos.</p>

    <h3>What I’m building</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>PM Canvas Agent — converts idea mind‑dumps into canvases and lightweight mocks for problem/solution, impact, personas, and market fit.</li>
      <li>Browser‑first micro‑apps — zero‑setup HTML/CSS/JS tools that ship in hours, not weeks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stack & strengths</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A backend Java developer in the past but I am technically strong on front-end and easily adapt to technologies!</li>
      <li>Enterprise backbone: Pega integration and workflow automation.</li>
      <li>Shipping speed: rapid prototyping with all latest & greatest platforms & LLMs</li>
      <li>Continuous innovation: I believe that continuously innovating pushes you to go the extra mile and helps you learn something new. Therefore, I participate in hackathons to make an impact both internally and externally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Writing & posts</h3>
    <p>I write short, practical notes on agentic patterns, low‑code ergonomics, and making GenAI useful in daily workflows.</p>
    <p>Start at the <a href="{{ '/blog' | relative_url }}">Blog</a>, and you’ll find linked demos and canvases alongside each post.</p>
